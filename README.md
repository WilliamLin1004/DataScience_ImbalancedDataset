# DataScience_ImbalancedDataset_Discussion
Discussion on imbalanced dataset. Refer to the pdf file.<br>

Experiments were done using Weka when testing different classification methods.

## Preprocessing
Imbalanced datasets are dangerous to work with,therefore require some data preprocessing to reduce the problems caused by it. Some methods include, undersampling and oversampling. One of the methods in oversampling is SMOTE, which is tested in the experiment of DataSceince_ImbalancedDataset_Implementation.

## Classification
Performance is said to vary according to different classification methods. Therefore, different algorithms of classification are tested in the experiment conducted in Weka.

## Performance Metric
One of the reasons that imbalanced datasets are so dangerous to work with is that they tend to get a really good accuracy result. However, this might not be a very good measure for performance of model when its comes to imbalanced datasets. Therefore, other measurements, f1-score, recall, precision,...etc. are more preffered.
